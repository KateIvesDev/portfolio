## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, JavaScript

I used Boostrap 5 as the framework for my portfolio and customized some CSS and Sass to make it look less Boostrap-py.  The hero animation is from Lottie Files and the illustrations are from Undraw. It uses an open source font, +JakartaSans. The site is deployed to and hosted by Netlify.  It includes a Mailchimp form for the newsletter subscription. It also uses the Animate on Scroll library. 

## Optimizations

The Lighthouse report gives a very good performance score for desktop (97), but needs improvement om the mobile version (79). For the next version I will focus on improving mobile performance and accessibility scores.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a ton about Boostrap and Sass, neither of which I had used before. I realized that I have a lot to learn about design. Had fun making some of the gradient accents work, especially the button that has the glow gradient. And I learned that you can also style the scroll bar, so why not?


## Future Updates:
I want to add my Github heatmap but replace green square with colors that complement the color scheme. And more examples of my work!
